# Convenience script for fetching auxiliary files that are omitted from
# the version control repository of this package.
#
# This script requires either
#   - the LIBTOOL_RELEASES_DIR environment variable pointing to a directory
#     that contains libtool release tarballs, or
#   - a copy of the newest libtool-x.y.z.tar.gz in the current directory, or
#   - the wget program in the PATH and an internet connection.
